In COVID-19 analysis using Power BI, I successfully identified critical trends and key performance metrics. The recovery rate was 87.70%, and the death rate was 0.99%. Asia had the highest number of serious cases at 14,733, while Africa had the fewest critical cases at 529. Out of 1,410 million total recorded cases, 28 million were active. This analysis showcases my proficiency in data visualization and my ability to derive actionable insights for informed decision-making.
